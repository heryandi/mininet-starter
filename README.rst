About
=====

This is the Mininet starter package.
It is recommended to use this as a base to start developing your Mininet
package.

Usage:
------

To use this package as a base to develop new package, download this package
from the download button below and extract it inside your virtual environment
folder.

The most important thing is to look at the example folder structure and
setup.py. The example python source code on how to create and run a Mininet 
experiment may also be helpful.

You may want to install this package to see the effect to your virtual
environment. To install this package, use this command:

    mnp download mininet-starter

Once installed, 3 executables will become available inside the virtual
environment:

- starter_bin

- starter_console_script_1 

- starter_console_script_2

You may want to look at how each of these executables are created, especially
the latter two which are created automatically only by specifying it in
setup.py.

You may also want to look at this file itself (README.rst) to see how this
documentation is generated using reST syntax.
